tweetalytc
Twitter user analytics JavaScript API.
By Ryan Sandor Richards

Getting Started

In order to use the libraries provided in this package you must first include 
jQuery (the Twitter adapter requires it to perform JSONP requests to the 
Twitter API).

You can download the newest version of jQuery at their website:

	http://jquery.com

Then simply include the JS files in the head or body of your
HTML document in this order:

<script type="text/javascript" src="[PATH TO JQUERY SCRIPT]"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/twitter.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/tweetalytc.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="javascripts/googlechart.js"></script>

Please read the in-source documentation for how to use the scripts in your
project. Thanks for using tweetalytc!
